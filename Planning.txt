# Goal

Building an intelligent, user-friendly personal 
finance + meal planner assistant using GenaI + RAG to help me 
manage my expenses in my unemployment days

# Modules (Proposed)

1. AI Agent : Handles all AI-related responses using LangGraph, with optional search and RAG
2. Expense Tracker : Add, update, list, and view expenses â€” store in local DB or JSON
3. Meal Planner : Take user info (age, weight, etc.) and generate meals with AI help
4. RAG Engine : Retrieve helpful facts from PDFs, CSVs, or scraped Indian data
5. Frontend UI : Built in Streamlit to interact with all systems
6. FastAPI Backend : API to act as a bridge between AI Agent, RAG, and UI

# Tech Stack to be used

1. LLM : OpenAI(gpt-4o (limited use as limited credits), gpt-4o-mini etc), Groq(various models (eg. Deepseek))
2. Agent Framework : LangChain + LangGraph
3. Backend : FastAPI
4. Frontend : Streamlit
5. Vector DB : FAISS or Chroma (not decided yet)
6. File Parsing : LangChain DocumentLoaders
7. Deployment : maybe Render or Hugging Face spaces (decision pending)
